## **üöÄ Setup Guide**

Getting started is simple. Follow these steps to install the application:

1. **Download the Installer:** Go to the [**GitHub Releases**](https://github.com/itsmeeudrino/mania-explorer/releases) page.  
2. **Get the Latest Version:** Download the .msi installer file from the latest release.  
3. **Run the Installer:** Double-click the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the application.

### **‚ùó Important First-Time Setup Note**

The very first time you click "Play" on a map, your computer won't know how to open the map file. Windows will show a prompt asking you how to open a .Map.Gbx file.

**You must select Trackmania.exe from your game's installation folder.**

* Click **"More apps"**.  
* Scroll down and click **"Look for another app on this PC"**.  
* Navigate to where you installed Trackmania (e.g., C:\\Program Files\\Ubisoft\\Ubisoft Game Launcher\\games\\Trackmania).  
* Select Trackmania.exe.  
* Make sure the "Always use this app to open .Map.Gbx files" checkbox is ticked.

You only need to do this once\! After that, all maps will open in the game automatically.
